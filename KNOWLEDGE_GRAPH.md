# Chief Productivity Officer (CPO) — Knowledge Graph & Semantic Architecture

This document provides a formal, comprehensive Knowledge Graph and architectural mapping of the **Chief Productivity Officer (CPO)** Discord bot repository. It maps directory boundaries, component topologies, execution lifecycles, state invariants, database schemas, and external dependencies to enable autonomous AI agents and engineers to navigate, reason about, and modify the codebase with precision.

## 4. State & Invariants

- **Application command visibility**: `bot.py:setup_hook` syncs the global command tree, then `on_ready` replaces each guild's command set with a copy of the global commands and syncs it for immediate visibility. Manager commands use Discord `default_permissions` that match their permission checks.
- **Study group lookups**: `DBHandler.get_user_group`, `get_study_group_by_channel`, and `get_study_group` return dictionaries so cogs can consistently read records with `.get()` and map database IDs to in-memory sessions.
- **Study group membership**: `save_study_group` writes the creator and initial invitees to `study_groups_members` under the group UUID. Group roster reads and `/list_groups` use that same UUID.
- **Invitations and admission**: `GroupInvitationView` sends recipient-only Join/Decline controls by DM. A group membership lock serializes invitations and direct joins, enforces capacity, and prevents admission during teardown. Memory membership follows successful role assignment and persistence; a failed database write triggers role rollback.
- **Legacy migration**: Startup adds missing columns, maps numeric IDs to text, and preserves old records and rosters. Historical `study_groups_db` and `study_group_members_db` names are renamed when the current tables are absent. The earliest schema's `max_size`, session role, and voice channel map to current fields. Records without an old activity flag default to inactive; unavailable category, text-channel, and start-time fields retain neutral defaults.
- **Group lifecycle**: Saving a group retains its numeric primary key. Ending sets `active=0`, removes current roster entries, stops the dashboard view, and removes every matching Pomodoro alias. Active channel, name, guild, and user lookups exclude ended groups.
- **Task menus**: Select values use database primary keys; `apply_task_action` checks the owner and exact group, including a null global scope. Typed task commands retain ID/number handling. Purges use one database deletion and remove only matching bot task messages attributed to the invoking user among the latest 100 messages in the current text channel.
- **Server-scoped tasks**: The `tasks` table stores `guild_id`. Default `/task_list` is scoped to the user's current guild and active group (or global tasks outside groups), preventing tasks from bleeding across different Discord servers. `all_groups: True` lists cross-group tasks and is sent ephemerally.
- **Server setup**: Every `/setup` invocation opens an ephemeral wizard owned by its invoker. Existing categories and newly named categories remain draft choices until Save. Save resolves the category, creates `cpo-commands` and `cpo-logs` text channels or reuses their recorded channels, and persists category ID, commands channel ID, moderator log channel ID, and default member limit together. New logs channels restrict visibility to the bot, invoker, and Administrator or Manage Server roles. Cancel and expiry leave saved settings unchanged. Changed resources from a failed Save remain available for retry; cancellation and expiry disclose their IDs.
- **Commands-channel response visibility**: Normal slash success replies are public only when the invocation channel ID equals `guild_settings.commands_channel_id`. Threads, other channels, DMs, unset settings, and lookup failures keep replies private. Errors, sensitive results, and cross-group task lists remain private everywhere. Category membership and matching channel names do not enable public replies.
- **Operational message destinations**: Group dashboards, check-in reminders, Pomodoro announcements, moderator logs, and invitation DMs continue to use their own channels or recipients. Their placement is independent of the slash reply policy.
- **Moderator logs**: `guild_settings.mod_log_channel_id` stores the optional destination for creation, ending, and purge embeds. Logs suppress mentions. Missing channels and logging API/database failures do not abort the action.
- **Voice controls and dashboard**: Speak and Video preserve other permission overwrites and persist their settings. Database failures trigger Discord permission rollback. The initial dashboard carries member mentions, the status embed, and controls together. Force Video warns members after 30 seconds and allows a 60-second camera grace period before disconnecting members who remain camera-off.
- **Regression execution**: Pytest includes `tests/test_release_fixes.py` and the standalone command matrix. The matrix uses an in-memory database and closes the bot in `finally`.

| Component | State Medium | Concurrency & Sync Mechanism | Invariant Rules |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Study Groups** | In-Memory (`StudyGroupCog.sessions`) & SQLite (`study_groups`) | Synchronized during lifecycle events; hydrated from SQLite on startup. | An active study group must hold valid `text_id`, `vc_id`, and `group_role_id`. When terminated, channels and roles must be deleted, `active` set to `0`, and memory references popped. |
| **Pomodoro Engine** | In-Memory (`Pomodoro.sessions`) & SQLite (`pomodoro_sessions`) | Tick evaluation via background loop; notifications routed to channel. | The ratio between Focus, Short Break, and Long Break must strictly obey `(focus, focus // 5, focus * 3 // 5)`. After 4 cycles, Long Break is enforced. |
| **Check-in Standups** | In-Memory (`CheckinCog.active_sessions`) & SQLite (`checkin_sessions`) | Periodic `asyncio.sleep` reminder loop with member state dict. | Member absences cannot be negative. If absences exceed `max_absences`, member status transitions to `exited` or is kicked from group. |
| **Task Lists** | SQLite (`tasks`) | Atomic parameterized SQL queries under `async with self.lock:`. | If invoked inside a study group channel (`channel_id`), tasks are strictly scoped to `group_id`. Global tasks are isolated from group tasks. |
| **Permission Controls** | Memory Cache & SQLite (`managers`) | Dynamic permission resolution cascading across 5 tiers. | Superuser `BOT_DEVELOPER` (ID in `.env`) unconditionally overrides all guild-level and group-level permissions. |
| **Database Access Layer** | Thread-Safe DAL (`DBHandler`) | All reads and writes wrapped in `async with self.lock:`. | No unparameterized queries. `sqlite3.Row` factory enabled for dict-like key access. |

---

## 5. External Dependencies & Integration Points

| Dependency | Category | Role in System | Failure Modes & Mitigations |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Discord Gateway (WebSocket)** | External Service | Real-time event streaming (`INTERACTION_CREATE`, `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE`). | Connection drops handled by discord.py auto-reconnect; sessions persist in SQLite. |
| **Discord REST API (HTTP)** | External Service | Channel/Role provisioning, embed sending, permissions modification. | Rate limits (HTTP 429) mitigated by interaction deferral and pacing. Embeds capped at 25 fields to avoid HTTP 400. |
| **SQLite 3 (`bot_database.sqlite`)** | Local Storage | Structured relational data store for all persistent state. | File corruption or contention mitigated by `asyncio.Lock()` serializing transactions. |
| **Python Standard Library `audioop`** | Native Runtime | Used internally by Discord voice audio subsystem. | Deprecated in Python 3.13; currently emitting a warning on Python 3.12. |
| **Environment Variables (`.env`)** | Configuration | Supplies `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`, `BOT_DEVELOPER_ID`, `DB_NAME`. | Missing token halts boot in `bot.py` with explicit configuration error. |
